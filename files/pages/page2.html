		<h1> SPAGHETTI AND MEAT SAUCE </h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<h3> Ingredients </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> 1 pound lean ground meat like beef, turkey, chicken or lamb </li>
			<li> 3 tablespoons olive oil </li>
			<li> 1 cup (130 grams) chopped onion </li>
			<li> 3 garlic cloves, minced (1 tablespoon) </li>
			<li> 2 tablespoons tomato paste </li>
			<li> 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano </li>
			<li> Pinch crushed red pepper flakes </li>
			<li> 1 cup water, broth or dry red wine </li>
			<li> 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes </li>
			<li> Salt and fresh ground black pepper </li>
			<li> Handful fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving </li>
			<li> 12 ounces dried spaghetti or favorite pasta shape </li>
			<li> 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese </li>

		</ul>

		<h3> Directions for Sauce </h3>
		<ol>
			<li> Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about
				8 minutes. <i>(As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles)</i> </li>
			<li> Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened <i>(about 5 minutes.)</i> </li>
			<li> Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute. </li>
			<li> Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. </li>
			<li>  Stir in the tomatoes, &frac34; teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. </li>
      <li>  Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. </li>
      <li>  As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly. </li>

      
		</ol>
    <h3> Directions for Spaghetti </h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Start cooking the spaghetti about 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking. </li>
      <li> Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions </li>
      <li> Check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3> TO FINISH </h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil.  </li>
      <li> Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce.  </li>
      <li> Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top. </li>
    </ol>
